Streetsweeper is a two wheel, high energy disc spinner beetleweight battlebot built for NHRL competitions. It features large wheels powered by Dartbox Gecko motors for maximum agility and nimbleness around arenas. It also features a large high energy disc spinner mounted under the chassis powered by a PropDrive 3536 motor to deliver huge hits with high impact energy and bite. Overall, this bot is also quite defensive, featuring solid wheelguards, aluminum chassis armor, and an angled front, mitigating impacts from opponents.


## Reason for design

I designed Streetsweeper as a member of my school's battlebots team in order to further my design/cadding skills, to challenge my self in the realm of design, and to give myself a significant project I could present to younger students and others. I designed this bot after designing a fairyweight (.3lb) bot as the next step up. This experience also made me learn and develop many new skills such as learning new cad features like Boolean Removal, how to wire components, materials researching, and design skills like knowing how to balance weight, power, etc.


## Goals

I intend to finish building the bot before spring break, and if it's successful, fighting it against other 3lb bots from my school's club, and maybe even taking it to an NHRL competition if it proves successful.
